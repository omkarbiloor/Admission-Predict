# Admission Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict university admission chances based on student data. The project uses various features such as entrance exam scores, previous academic performance, and other relevant factors to determine the likelihood of admission.

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Admission Prediction** project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts the chances of a student getting admitted to a university based on:

- **GRE Score**
- **TOEFL Score**
- **University Rating**
- **SOP (Statement of Purpose) Strength**
- **LOR (Letter of Recommendation) Strength**
- **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)**
- **Research Experience**

The model helps in predicting the chances of a student's admission to graduate school by analyzing these factors.

## 🛠 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Model Selection**: Use of Linear Regression or other suitable models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Data visualization for better understanding and model interpretability.

## 📁 File Structure

- **`Admission predict.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the model implementation, data processing steps, and evaluation metrics.
- **`admission_data.csv`** (or any dataset used): The dataset containing the student features.
- Additional files, if any.

## 🛑 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting.
